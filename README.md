This repo contains the slides and the demos for a talk I gave on Computer Vision for high school students at MIT's annual hackathon - MIT Blueprints.

The basic idea is to introduce students to the broad level perspective of how a neural network and deep learning works without any mathematics, while still stressing on the importance of the mathematics if someone needs to build such systems!

Here's link to the youtube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO3yP4ftB3U&feature=youtu.be

Short description of demos -

Demo 1 - Face Detection in image
face_detect.py :- used to run face detection on an image. 
USAGE: face_detect.py abba.png haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

Demo 2 - Face Detection from webcam
live.py

Demo 3 - Artificial Neural Network visualized with random data
Artificial Neural Network.py

Demo 4 - Deep Learning using Keras (Cats vs Dogs Image Classification)
keras3.py

Extra pictures provided for demo1.
